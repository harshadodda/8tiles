# 8tiles
Summary:

This program lets the user play the 8 tiles game. The user can play the classic game by themselves or they can ask the 
program to see if there is a solution for the current board state. If there is a solution, the program will terminate after 
the solution is reached, if there is no solution, the program will terminate at the best possible board state. 
the player can set the starting board state and play from that state as well. The user can move tiles by clicking on a tile that is adjacent to the blank tile. The tile that was clicked on will then move to where the blank tile was. 

Here is a sample of the program running:

Step 1: Lets have the program set up a random board for us, initially. The initial board it gave us looks like this:

Step 2: Lets move a few tiles and see what happens. We will move the tiles in the following order: 3, 5, 6, 3. The screen shots will show the 4 moves in order. Each screen shot will show the board state before the move. The 5th screen shot will show the board state after the 4 moves.
